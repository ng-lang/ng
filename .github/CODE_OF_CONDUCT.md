# Code of Conduct

We want to create a relaxed and harmonious communication context for the NG community. We believe that a positive and respectful environment is essential for collaboration and creativity.

## Our Principles

*   **Be kind and respectful:** Treat everyone with respect. We are all here to learn and grow together.
*   **Be open-minded:** We welcome different opinions and perspectives. Let's have constructive discussions and debates.
*   **Be helpful:** If you see someone who needs help, please lend a hand. We are a community, and we should support each other.
*   **Be patient:** We are all at different levels of experience. Be patient with newcomers and those who are still learning.

## What We Expect

*   **Communicate with empathy:** Try to understand others' perspectives and feelings.
*   **Give constructive feedback:** When you are giving feedback, be specific, and focus on the code, not the person.
*   **Accept feedback gracefully:** When you receive feedback, be open to it and don't take it personally.

## What We Don't Tolerate

We do not tolerate any form of harassment or discrimination. This includes, but is not limited to:

*   Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion.
*   Unwelcome comments regarding a personâ€™s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.
*   Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
