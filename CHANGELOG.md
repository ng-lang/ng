## [Unreleased]

### Added - ORGASM Level-2 Implementation

#### Core Features
- **ORGASM Level-2 Parser and Interpreter** - Complete implementation of the ORGASM (Organized Assembly) Level-2 intermediate representation
  - Lexer for tokenizing ORGASM directives and instructions (`src/orgasm/lexer.cpp`)
  - Parser for module structure, data sections, and functions (`src/orgasm/parser.cpp`)
  - Stack-based interpreter/VM for bytecode execution (`src/orgasm/interpreter.cpp`)
  
#### Type System
- Support for comprehensive primitive types:
  - Signed integers: i8, i16, i32, i64, i128
  - Unsigned integers: u8, u16, u32, u64, u128
  - Floating point: f16, f32, f64, f128
  - Boolean, char, unit, and address types
  - Vector types: v128, v256, v512
  - Atomic types: atomic.i32, atomic.i64, atomic.addr

#### Operations
- Arithmetic operations: add, subtract, multiply, divide
- Comparison operations: gt, lt, ge, le, eq, ne
- Logical operations: and, or, xor, not
- Bitwise operations: shl, shr
- Control flow: br, goto, return with label support
- Function calls and native import handling
- Tuple operations: tuple_create, tuple_destroy, tuple_get, tuple_set
- Type casting between compatible types
- Stack operations: load_*, store_*, push_param

#### Security Features
- Platform-specific secure memory initialization
  - `explicit_bzero` on glibc 2.25+ systems
  - `SecureZeroMemory` on Windows platforms
  - Volatile pointer fallback for other platforms
- Prevents compiler optimization from removing memory clearing operations
- Proper memory cleanup with tuple_destroy opcode

#### Documentation
- Added ORGASM Level-2 design specification (`docs/ref/orgasm_level2_design.md`)
- Example ORGASM assembly files in `example/orgasm/` directory (14 examples)
- Updated AGENTS.md with ORGASM architecture details

#### Testing
- Comprehensive test suite with 49 test cases and 128 assertions
  - Lexer tests: tokenization, comments, punctuation, EOF handling
  - Parser tests: modules, data sections, arrays, multiple data types
  - Interpreter tests: arithmetic, control flow, tuple operations, type casting
  - Integration tests: end-to-end execution, complex scenarios, mixed types
- All existing tests continue to pass (907 assertions in 174 test cases)

### Fixed
- Security vulnerability in tuple memory initialization
- Parser validation for duplicate parameter definitions
- Error handling for instructions without proper context
- Function parameter and instruction parsing order

### Changed
- Updated CMakeLists.txt to include ORGASM sources and tests
- Modified .gitmodules to use HTTPS URLs for submodules (build fix)
- Enhanced compiler flag detection for coverage support

## Commit History

```

## Statistics

- **Files Added**: 12 (6 headers, 3 implementation files, 3 test files)
- **Lines of Code**: ~1,972 lines total
  - Implementation: ~1,465 lines
  - Headers: ~507 lines
- **Test Coverage**: 49 test cases with 128 assertions for ORGASM components
- **Overall Test Success**: 174 test cases with 907 assertions passing

## Future Work

The ORGASM Level-2 implementation provides a foundation for:
- CLI integration to run `.l2.asm` files directly with `ngi`
- Validation with all example files in `example/orgasm/`
- Additional instruction types (SIMD operations, atomic operations)
- Optimization passes
- Bytecode generation for native compilation
- JIT compilation support
