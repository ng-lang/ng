# Overview

ng is an interpreted, dynamically-typed scripting language with the following key features:

- Object-oriented programming support (classes, inheritance, polymorphism)
- Functional programming features (higher-order functions, closures)
- Imperative programming constructs
- Built-in string and collection operations
- Module system for code organization

## Execution Model

ng code is executed through the following phases:

1. Lexical analysis - converts source code to tokens
2. Syntax analysis - builds abstract syntax tree (AST)
3. Interpretation - directly executes the AST
