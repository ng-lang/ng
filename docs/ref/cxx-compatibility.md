# C++ Compilers and Compatibility

We recommend using the latest C++ standard (currently C++23) and compiler. However, platform support for certain features can vary.

Use the `feature_test` utility (`test/feature_test.cpp`) to verify feature support on your platform. For more details, see the [C++ Reference Feature testing](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/feature_test.html) page.

You can also see `.github/features.txt` to see what features are supported on Github Actions build pipeline.
