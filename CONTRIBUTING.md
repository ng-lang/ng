# Contribution Guide

We welcome contributions from the community! This guide will help you get started with contributing to the NG programming language.

## Setting up the Development Environment

To contribute to the NG language, you will need to set up a development environment. Please follow the instructions in the [Getting Started](./docs/guide/language_guide.md#2-getting-started) section of the language guide to build the project.

## How to Contribute

We follow the standard GitHub flow for contributions:

1.  **Fork the repository:** Create your own fork of the `ng-lang/ng` repository.
2.  **Create a branch:** Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
3.  **Make your changes:** Make your changes to the codebase.
4.  **Write tests:** Add tests for your changes to ensure they work as expected.
5.  **Update documentation:** If you are adding a new feature, be sure to update the documentation.
6.  **Submit a pull request:** Open a pull request from your branch to the `master` branch of the `ng-lang/ng` repository.

## Where to Contribute

We have a lot of areas where you can contribute. You can refer the Roadmap section of [README](./README.md) page.

## AI (LLM) Generated Code

If you are using AI (LLM) to generate code, you **MUST** indicate which code was generated by AI. You are also responsible for ensuring that the generated code is licensed correctly and does not violate any copyrights.

## Code Style

We use `clang-format` to enforce a consistent code style for C++ code. Please make sure your code is formatted with `clang-format` before submitting a pull request. We also use `clang-tidy` to check for common C++ issues.

For NG code, we recommend following the style of the existing examples in the `example` directory.
